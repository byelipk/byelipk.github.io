# Decisions, decisions.

Remember dial-up?

Remember staring blankly at the screen waiting for AOL to load?

Imagine that situation, but assume you only had 2 hours of electricity per day.

How would you spend your time online?

In 2013, I asked myself this question each time I used the internet. My answer was the same each time: I needed to learn to code.

# Volunteers at heart.

I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Guinea, which is a very poor country located on the West African coast. My job was to improve access to curative malaria medication and prevent "stock outs."

In Guinea, community health workers, or CHWs for short, are the first point of contact a patient has with the health care system. CHWs are the ones in the villages diagnosing and treating patients. Have a fever? Save yourself a day-long trek to the health center, and find your village CHW instead.

CHWs have to be smart, detail orientated, energetic, and persuasive. Yes, they need to be competent health care providers. How would you like it if someone who always missed the vein had to draw blood from your arm? However, they also have to be diplomats and marketeers. For example, if there's a polio vaccination campaign ongoing, it's not enough for a CHW to administer the vaccine; they have to convince the community to get their children vaccinated as well.

The thing about CHWs that impressed me the most was that they are volunteers. That might sound strange coming from a volunteer. It's true, we had volunteering in common. However, our reasons for volunteering were a bit different. I joined the Peace Corps in 2010 to go on an adventure and see more of the world. For folks in rural Guinea, their motivation to volunteer as a community health worker was less self-centered: they wanted to protect the health and wellbeing of their community. That's not to say they didn't have their selfish reasons either. Being a CHW usually comes with an increase in social status, a stipend for participating in training workshops, and a bicycle for transportation. However, I was always energized by the enthusiasm with which they did good for others. In return, I wanted to do good for them.

# NGO Alley

Health care in Guinea is driven by large, international non-governmental organizations that champion a cause. In Guinea's capital of Conakry, there's a part of town I call "NGO Alley." All along NGO Alley you'll find organizations dedicated to causes like pre-natal care, oral hygiene, or family planning. Since CHWs play such an important role in the health care system, all of these NGOs rely on them in some way. If we were going to improve access to malaria medication, we had to fight our way through the noise of NGO Alley.

There were two ways to do this. First, we had to make sure our solution conformed to how a CHW did their job. If we created more work for a CHW, our solution, whatever it ended up being, would fail. Ideally, we would reduce their workload. At the very least, their workload should stay the same. The other thing I thought our solution had to do was delight CHWs. It had to make them feel proud about themselves and about the contribution they were making to their community.

If we nailed those two things, I thought we'd have a chance to reduce "stock outs."

# A long way to the top.

The basic notion of how one actually prevents a "stock out" goes like this: "Deliver the right thing, to the right place, at the right time, and at the right quantity."

In other words, we needed to ensure that all the records of malaria medication stock for every CHW got to the national pharmacy each month. If we did that, then the national pharmacy could send the medication where it needed to go. However, that wasn't happening. As a result, health centers ran out of malaria medication all the time. How could this be?

On paper, the system was sound. Each CHW would deliver a monthly report to their health center. The health center would then aggregate the data and pass it on to the regional health director. The data would make its way up the chain until it reached the national pharmacy. It was your run-of-the-mill organizational hierarchy, common among health systems all over the world.

In practice, however, the system ran into hurdle after hurdle. It broke down most acutely at the village level. Why? It didn't take long for me to come up with a theory: it was the roads. You know, those things we drive on? Well, they don't exist in other parts of the world. So when you want to send something from point A to B, it can become very costly and time consuming.

In West Africa, the rainy season corresponds roughly to the spring and summer months in the US. Malaria cases spike during the rainy season. If there's any time for this data collection pipeline to be on the ball, it's during the rainy season. But the long, interconnected network of dirt roads and bush trails that connect villages to main towns wash out and become difficult or impossible to pass. CHWs, God love 'em, came up with workarounds.

The most common workaround was to give their report to a taxi driver who happened to be making the trek to the main town. Upon arrival, the taxi driver would either deliver the report directly to the health center or pass it on to someone else who would deliver it for them. This tactic was great when it worked. However, it didn't work all the time. Sometimes reports would get lost in transit. Other times the delivery man couldn't find the place he needed to bring the reports. In situations like these, it was common for us to go to the taxi pool and wait for the taxi to arrive. With so many hands involved, the data "custody chain" became muddied to the point where it was difficult to verify data.

# Everyone has a phone.

When you're trying to figure out what problem to solve, as I was, one thing to look for is how people use workarounds to get a job done.

The CHWs had a job to do - they had to get information from point A to point B in as reliably and quickly a way as possible. On most days they would hire the road system to do this job. When that wasn't possible, they hired a courier who would use the road system for them.

However, I imagined a world where CHWs could just as easily hire their cell phone to do that job as well. I mean, everyone had a phone. It was usually a simple Nokia model without a touchscreen and without "apps." Phones were cheap. Phone credit was cheap. Solar panels were in widespread use to charge phones. Network coverage was improving weekly. If there wasn't network coverage in your immediate vicinity, most of the time all you had to do was climb a tree. Then, miraculously, you'd see one or two bars show up on the top of your screen.  

When a CHW finished work for the day, they could aggregate their numbers, then send a us text message. We would then update their stock levels in a database and share that information with their health center, also via text.

I started to throw the idea around my partner organization. The first person I mentioned it to was my counterpart, Tidiane. When I told him, I was expecting him to be as excited as me, but all I got was, "It's too expensive."

"I'm sorry, what?" I said.

"It's too expensive. CHWs are going to ask us to buy phone credit. Then they'll ask us to buy phones. It'll get complicated" Tidiane said.

Personally, I didn't think those were unfair requests. "Maybe we should buy them new smart phones with data plans," I thought. However, I knew the organization was going through a rut in funding. Our multi-year contract had just run out. We were negotiating new funding, but there just wasn't enough for any new major projects.

Did your writing teacher ever tell you to "show, not tell"? That's what I needed to do to convince people in my organization this was a good idea.

# Do you know Java?

I viewed myself as computer savvy. With my dad’s help, I had built my desktop computer from scratch. I could usually figure out how to make my computer do what I wanted; I could bend Google to my will to find the answer. That was the extent of my computer knowledge.

My first searches into “short message service,” or SMS, probably occurred in January of 2013. All I knew about SMS was that’s what the Europeans, and by extension, the Guineans, called a text message.

I had a vague notion of how SMS had been used to improve health care in other parts of the world. During my training in Senegal, we listened to a presentation from a co-founder of Medic Mobile, a company working in the nascent field of “mHealth.” They had developed a technology to convert the simple, Nokia phones, so common across the African continent, into data collection machines.

I emailed their Operations Officer in Kenya, Maeghan, to schedule a time to chat about what we were up to in Guinea and to see if their technology could help. I expected Maeghan to give me a call at 3pm my time. However, the minutes ticked by and she still hadn’t called. I sent her an email to see if everything was ok. She replied almost immediately that their car had been pulled over several times by police who were seeking to solicit bribes; that was the cause of the delay. They were still several hours away from a place where she could talk. We joked she was having “a day you can only have in Africa.” I empathized with her and teased I was due for a day like that myself. We agreed to talk the next week.

I sat out on the porch at the Peace Corps transit house in Boké, Guinea. Maeghan sat in a cafe in Nairobi, Kenya. We talked about mHealth, Guinea, and Medic Mobile. At one point in the conversation she asked, “Do you know Java?”
“Uhh, yup!”, I said.

I was too shy to say I didn’t know what she was talking about. I remembered from listening to Medic Mobile’s co-founder, Isaac, that when they got started, none of them knew how to code. They just sat in their room working their way through programming books till they figured out what they needed to know. After my chat with Maeghan, I had a feeling a similar fate awaited me.

# To buy, or to build?

As I continued my research I came across another vendor called Dimagi. Unfortunately, their software only worked on phones capable of running, you guessed it, Java. Java is a programming language and a runtime. If you have the Java runtime, you can run software written in the Java programming language. After installing and trying to run their software on my phone, I learned it didn't have the Java runtime. I was forced to buy another phone that did.

My Peace Corps stipend was $150 a month. I had some extra stipend money from my partner organization, but I was still living at the poverty line in Guinea. A new phone would cost another $35. As long as I was using it for my research, I didn't mind the expense. However, many CHWs were below the poverty line, and I knew we couldn't ask them to buy new phones. That would be too hefty an ask.

I made many trips into the Boké town market to shop for cell phones. I always went to Mohammad's little boutique, smack dab in the middle of the market. Mohammad was a Peul. In the cast system, Peuls are well known for being merchants.

Mohammad's shop was tiny. It was stocked to the roof with things like cookies, powdered milk, and cooking oil.

Whever I visited him at h He was around my age, but had a family already.  I would always go to Mohammad because he would let me









However, Dimagi was accepting applications from organizations like ours to create a pilot program with their technology. What peaked my interest, though, was that they would provide phones. While part of me was focused on using the resources we have, another part of me was ok with it "as long as they're paying for the phones."

I pitched the idea to apply for this pilot project to our Chief of Party, Dan. Dan liked the idea, so I wrote it up using official organization letter head. When I finished, Dan sent it to the parent organization in the US for review. We never heard back.

It annoyed me the "home office" didn't get back to us. We were out there on the front lines working our butts off. The least they could have done was write back, "Thanks, but no thanks." The lack of institutional support we were receiving just meant I'd have to go it alone for a short time till I developed a working prototype of the system I had in mind.


Besides, one of my goals was to leverage the phones CHWs were already using. I wanted to use technology CHWs were familiar with in order to reduce the time it would take to train them to use the new system. Plus, if we used technology already available us, that would reduce cost. That seemed a more sustainable approach to me.
