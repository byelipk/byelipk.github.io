# Decisions, decisions.

Remember dial-up?

Remember staring blankly at the screen waiting for AOL to load?

Imagine that situation, but assume you only had 2 hours of electricity per day.

How would you spend your time online?

In 2013, I asked myself this question each time I used the internet. My answer was the same each time: I needed to learn to code.

# No free lunch.

I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Guinea, which is a very poor country located on the West African coast. My job was to improve access to curative malaria medication.

In Guinea, community health workers, or CHWs for short, are the first point of contact a patient has with the health care system. CHWs are the ones in the villages diagnosing and treating patients. Have a fever? Save yourself a day-long trek to the health center, and find your village CHW instead.

CHWs have to be smart, detail orientated, energetic, and persuasive. Yes, they need to be able to provide competent health care. They frequently draw blood, analyze test results, and prescribe medication. If they didn't do any of those things well, they wouldn't be good at their job. However, they also have to be diplomats and marketeers. For example, if there's a polio vaccination campaign ongoing, it's not enough for a CHW to administer the vaccine; they have to convince the community to get their children vaccinated.

CHWs are volunteers. That's what resonated most with me. I was a volunteer, but many of them had families to take care of and other jobs to attend to. 

Health care in Guinea is driven by large, international organizations that typically champion a single cause. In Guinea's capital of Conakry, there's a part of town I call "NGO Alley." All along NGO Alley you'll find organizations dedicated to causes like pre-natal care, oral hygiene, or family planning. Since CHWs play such an important role in the health care system, all of these interventions rely on them in some way. These interventions compete with each other for the CHWs time and energy, whether they know it or not.

If we were going to improve access to malaria medication, we had to make sure our solution conformed to how a community health worker did their job at present. However, it would be even better if our solution delighted them and made them feel prouder than ever of their vital role protecting the health and wellbeing of their community.

# A long way to the top.

It's very important for CHWs to keep meticulous records of their work. However, good record-keeping is not sufficient to prevent a stock-out. The basic notion of how one actually prevents a stock-out goes like this: "Deliver the right thing to the right place at the right time at the right quantity."

We needed to ensure that all the records of malaria medication stock for every CHW got to the national pharmacy each month. That wasn't happening. So that was the first puzzle we had to solve.

On paper, the system was sound. Each CHW would deliver a monthly report to their health center. The health center would then aggregate the data and pass it on to the regional health director. And on up the chain it went till it reached the pharmacy. It was your run-of-the-mill organizational hierarchy, common among health systems all over the world.

In practice, however, the system ran into hurdle after hurdle. It broke down most acutely at the village level. Why? It didn't take long for me to come up with a theory: it was the roads. You know, those things we drive on? Well, they don't exist in other parts of the world. And that makes getting your monthly report to the health center very costly sometimes.

In West Africa, the rainy season corresponds roughly to the spring and summer months in the US. Malaria cases spike during the rainy season. If there's any time for this data collection pipeline to be on the ball, it's during the rainy season. But the long, interconnected network of dirt roads and bush trails that connect villages to main towns wash out and become difficult or impossible to pass. CHWs, however, came up with workarounds.

The most common workaround was to give their report to a taxi driver who happened to be making the trek to the main town. Upon arrival, the taxi driver would either deliver the report directly to the health center or pass it on to someone else who would deliver it for them. This tactic really demonstrates the resourcefulness many Guineans have. It was great when it worked. However, it didn't work all the time. Also, with so many hands involved, the data "custody chain" gets muddied to the point where verifying data becomes difficult.

# Everyone has a phone.

When you're trying to figure out what problem to solve, as I was, one thing to look for is how people use workarounds to get a job done.

The CHWs had a job to do - they had to get information from point A to point B in as reliably and quickly a way as possible. On most days they themselves would hire the road system to do this job. When that wasn't an option, they hired a courier who would end up using the road system for them.

However, I imagined a world where they could just as easily hire their cell phone to do that job as well. I mean, everyone had a phone. It was usually a simple Nokia model without a touchscreen and without "apps." Phones were cheap. Phone credit was cheap. Solar panels were in widespread use to charge phones. Network coverage was improving weekly. If there wasn't network coverage in your immediate vicinity, most of the time all you had to do was get to high ground. Then, miraculously, you'd see one or two bars show up on the top of your screen.  

When a CHW finished work for the day, they could aggregate their numbers, then send a us text message. We would then update their stock levels and share that information with their health center, also via text.

I started to throw the idea around my partner organization. The first person I spoke to about it was my counterpart, Tidiane. When I told him, I was expecting him to be as excited as me, but all I got was, "It's too expensive."

"I'm sorry, what?" I said.

"It's too expensive. CHWs are going to ask us to buy phone credit. Then they'll ask us to buy phones. It'll get complicated" Tidiane said.

Personally, I didn't think those were unfair requests. However, I knew the organization was going through a rut in funding. Our multi-year contract had just run out. We were negotiating new funding, but there just wasn't enough for any new major projects.

Did your writing teacher ever tell you to "show, not tell"? That's what I needed to do to convince people in my organization this was a good idea.

# Show, don't tell.

I viewed myself as computer savvy. With my dad's help, I had built my desktop computer from scratch. I could usually figure out how to make my computer do what I wanted because I knew how to bend Google to my will to find the answer. That was the extent of my computer knowledge.

My first searches into "short message service," or SMS, probably occurred in January of 2013. All I knew about SMS was that's what the Europeans, and by extension, the Guineans, called a text message. I also had a vague notion of an SMS Gateway after hearing a presentation from the founder of a company working in the nascent field of "mHealth." It was pretty dense material, and it didn't take long for me to realize they were both dry holes as far as my situation was concerned.

I turned my search towards SMS services that seemed ready out-of-the-box. There I found a whole host of platforms that let you to run a text messaging campaigns. While I was moving in the right direction, that was not quite what I was looking for either.

Finally, I found platforms targeted towards community health workers. Bingo!

The first vendor I researched was called Dimagi. Unfortunately, their software only worked on phones capable of running Java. My primary phone couldn't run Java, so I had to buy another phone to test their software. It only cost $35, but my Peace Corps stipend was $150 a month. I had some extra stipend money from work with my partner organization, but all in all I was living a nudge above the poverty line in Guinea. Many CHWs were at or below the poverty line, so I knew we couldn't ask them to buy new phones. That would be too hefty an ask.

Besides, one of my goals was to leverage the phones CHWs were already using. I wanted to use technology CHWs were familiar with in order to reduce the time it would take to train them to use the new system. Plus, if we used technology already available us, that would reduce cost. That seemed a more sustainable approach to me.

However, Dimagi was accepting applications from organizations like ours to create a pilot program with their technology. What peaked my interest, though, was that they would provide phones. While part of me was focused on using the resources we have, another part of me was ok with it "as long as they're paying for the phones."

I pitched the idea to apply for this pilot project to our Chief of Party, Dan. Dan liked the idea, so I wrote it up using official organization letter head. When I finished, Dan sent it to the parent organization in the US for review. We never heard back.

It annoyed me the "home office" didn't get back to us. We were out there on the front lines working our butts off. The least they could have done was write back, "Thanks, but no thanks." The lack of institutional support we were receiving just meant I'd have to go it alone for a short time till I developed a working prototype of the system I had in mind.
